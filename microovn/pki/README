This directory holds CA certificate and private key provided by other
charms via tls_certificates relation.

It is OK for this directory to be empty if MicroOVN charm is not related
to a certificate provider. In such scenario, MicroOVN will use automatically
generated (self-signed) CA certificate instead.
